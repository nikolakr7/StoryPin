# StoryPin

A web application for newcomers/tourists to find and share real-world experiences. Instead of just searching for "restaurants," you can search for "first date" or "good_food" vibes. Then, you can see what others had to say about what you're looking for, through personal stories and photo collections. StoryPin lets you craft your trip itinerary around personal desires and genuine connection, all in one place.

# What It Does

This app has two main features:

Find Experiences: You can search for a location on the map and filter all the pins by a specific "desire tag" (e.g., "nightlife," "study," "great_view"). When you click a pin, you can see all the stories and photos other users have left, with the stories matching your filter sorted to the top.

Add Your Story: You can search for any location in the world using the Google Places search bar. You can then create a new pin (or add to an existing one) by uploading a photo, writing a title, sharing your story, and adding a preset "desire tag."
